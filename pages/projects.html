            <h2>A better "EIA Digital"</h2>
            <img src="../img/EIA_digital.jpeg" alt="Family Photo" class="photo">
            <p>At the university where I am currently studying, there are serious issues with managing student information and administrative tasks, starting with the "EIA Digital" platform, which only allows each student to be associated with a single program upon enrollment. For those of us in a double degree program, this becomes a problem when managing certain processes, such as course registration at the beginning of the semester or requesting a study certificate.
                <br><br>
                To address this, together with two other classmates, we developed a prototype for an improved "EIA Digital" system that facilitates the management of these various processes.</p>

            <h2>Dressings for leishmaniasis</h2>
            <img src="../img/apositos.webp" alt="Me Photo" class="photo">
            <p>Leishmaniasis is a relatively common disease in Colombia and tropical regions. It is an infectious disease caused by the Leishmania parasite, which leads to severe skin lesions that need to be properly treated. However, when these lesions occur in areas like the face, their treatment becomes more complicated. In addition to being a painful process, it affects the patient's appearance, impacting their emotional and mental health related to self-esteem.
                <br><br>
                Due to this, together with four other biomedical engineering classmates, we set out to develop dressings specifically designed to treat the lesions caused by this disease in the best possible way.

            <h2>BCI neuroprosthesis</h2>
            <img src="../img/BCI.jpg" alt="Me Photo" class="photo">
            <p>BCI prostheses, also known as "brain-machine interfaces," are a type of prosthesis that connects directly to the brain and is designed to stimulate brain areas responsible for a lost function.
                <br><br>
                In the case of cortical blindness, the lost function is the ability to translate the pixels that reach the occipital lobe cortex into clear images. Therefore, BCI neuroprostheses in this context stimulate that cortex, helping to largely restore the functions of that part of the brain.
                <br><br>
                Currently, it is the project I am researching the most, as it is the focus of my thesis development.
