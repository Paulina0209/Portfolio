            <h2>Let's talk about my family</h2>
            <img src="../img/familia.jpg" alt="Family Photo" class="photo">
            <p>My parents are Aída Elena Granda and Andrés Felipe Medina. My mother studied Public Accounting at UdeA and currently works as the 'Manager of Planning and Financial Management' at Grupo Excala.
                <br><br>
                My father, on the other hand, studied Mathematics and Physics at the same university and currently teaches Mathematics and Physics to higher-grade students (9th, 10th, and 11th) at San Antonio de Prado Educational Institution. A few years ago, he also taught Calculus and Mathematics at various universities, including UdeA, Universidad de Envigado, and ITM.

                My mother gave birth to me when she was 24 years old, amidst significant economic and health challenges, which led her to initially oppose having more children. However, fortunately for me, on December 20, 2012, my beautiful younger sister, Luciana, came into this world.
                <br><br>
                Luci is an artist, passionate about dance in its many forms. Her favorite hobbies include filming and editing videos, as well as testing my patience all the time.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, we have a furry member of the family, my dog, Kiara. She adds joy and companionship to our lives.</p>

            <h2>Now... A little about me</h2>
            <img src="../img/yo.jpg" alt="Me Photo" class="photo">
            <p>My full name is Paulina Medina Granda. I was born on February 9, 2005, which was actually Ash Wednesday. I attended a school called Colegio Empresarial, where I studied from kindergarten through eleventh grade. I always excelled in the humanities (English and Spanish), but as I grew older, I began to love mathematics and its magic, which also allowed me to perform well in those areas. This helped me decide to pursue an engineering degree.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I am enrolled in two undergraduate programs at EIA University: Biomedical Engineering and Systems Engineering. According to the university's evaluation system, I am in the sixth semester of Biomedical Engineering and the fourth semester of Systems Engineering.
                <br><br>
                Personally, I really enjoy laughing, which makes everyone close to me associate me with this trait since I am always smiling. However, this does not mean that I cannot be serious when needed; it simply means that, as much as possible, I try to approach everything with a cheerful attitude and see things from a positive perspective.
                <br><br>
                Regarding my friends, I have a few. From school, I only keep in touch with two friends, Luis and Sofía, in addition to my best friend from childhood, who is also named Sofía. Fortunately, in university, I have many wonderful people who have accompanied me during this stage of my professional development, and I hope they will continue to support me, and that we can all grow together.
