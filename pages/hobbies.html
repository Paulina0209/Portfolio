            <p>I learned to read at the age of 3 thanks to an aunt who was very passionate about reading; since then, I haven’t stopped. I really enjoy reading all kinds of books, which has allowed me to approach different fields of knowledge from various perspectives.
                <br><br>
                My favorite book is "Digital Fortress" and my favorite author is Dan Brown, who is, coincidentally, the author of this book and my favorite series, "The Adventures of Professor Robert Langdon." I’m also a big fan of the characters "Sherlock Holmes" and "Arsène Lupin" and the books associated with them.</p>

            <h2>Writing</h2>

            <p>Another hobby of mine is writing; I love creating and expressing things by letting my imagination flow. Since I was young, I have participated in various writing competitions and have generally done quite well in all of them.

                A funny anecdote about this is that once, in school, I had to write a poem about the book "María" by Jorge Isaacs as a task for Spanish class. Very inspired, I developed my poem, but when I submitted it, the teacher doubted that it was my own work and had to look it up to verify that it wasn’t taken from the internet.

                I participated in the first edition of EIA Cuenta and was selected among the stories in the book with a piece titled "The Valley of Memories." I also participated in this second edition and am still waiting to see the results.
